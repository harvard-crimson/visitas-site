        A picture is worth a thousand words. We at Multimedia are committed to bringing The Crimson to life with our photo and video content. Multimedia&rsquo;s photographs appear on the front page of The Crimson daily, and on the weekly Sports, Arts, and FM sections. Our videos air on thecrimson.com and have been featured on other sources such as Time, Business Insider, The Huffington Post, Boston Magazine, and Yahoo! News.

        Joining Multimedia won&rsquo;t just add to your college experience, rather it will enhance and change how you see Harvard. Something that every one of our members will vouch for is the fact that Harvard students on Multimedia attend events that they never would have gone to in the first place. We have access to all Harvard sporting events and major campus happenings such as The Hasty Pudding&rsquo;s Man of The Year and Woman of the Year Roasts, headlining concerts in Boston and Cambridge, Cultural Rhythms, all campus theater and music productions, speeches by heads-of-state&hellip; the list continues.
