      <p>
        We can&rsquo;t predict how you&rsquo;ll get famous, but we can promise you&rsquo;ll look good doing it. Comp Fifteen Minutes, the Crimson&rsquo;s weekly magazine, and hang out with the Cool Kids<sup>TM</sup> of 14 Plympton St.
      </p>
      <p>
        We publish The Crimson&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/10/15/audio-porn/">sexiest content</a>, from profiles of <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/topic/fifteen-seniors-2021/">quirky campus figures</a> to captivating <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/31/crimson-transcription/">retrospections</a>, with a little <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/9/my-mom-is-proctor/">levity</a> in between. Every once in a while, we talk about our <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/12/23/alex-endpaper/">feelings</a>. We are a bit of everything, in the best way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and we almost forgot: <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/29/harvard-undocumented-scrut/">scrutinies</a>. They&rsquo;re our weekly <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/12/12/ninety-six-hours-election-feature/">cover stories</a>, and consistently rank among the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/11/7/free-fall/">most-read</a> articles on The Crimson&rsquo;s website. "Scruts," as we call them, are long form deep dives into a variety of subjects &ndash; from <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/9/huds-covid-scrutiny/">HUDS workers&rsquo;</a> struggling to work during the pandemic, to Harvard students tapped by <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/5/campus-reform-scrutiny/">Fox News</a>, to an HMS professor&rsquo;s semi-spiritual <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/20/eben-alexander-profile/">brush with death</a>. If you&rsquo;re looking to flex your investigative reporting muscles, look no further.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you might say. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any investigative reporting muscles! I&rsquo;ve never written a magazine article in my life!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s where we come in: you&rsquo;ll join us for weekly comp seminars and staff writers&rsquo; meetings on Monday evenings, and you&rsquo;ll learn everything you need to know about writing for FM, from interview basics to structure and style. You&rsquo;ll refine your articles with brilliant editors and in turn, we hope, grow immensely as a writer.
      </p>

        FM lends critical eyes and surprising angles to timely news threads. When News writers were reporting live from the HUDS picket lines, we were <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/10/13/huds-strike-scrutiny/">at home with dining workers</a>, meeting the family members they were fighting to support. When President Obama nominated Harvard alum Merrick Garland &rsquo;77 to the Supreme Court, we called up his college roommates and learned about his <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/17/merrick-garland-harvard/">sick karate moves</a>.

        At FM, we do a lot more than sit around and look cool. (Although we do a fair amount of that too.) We want you to join us.
